## Hi, I'm Raey 👋🏽

![Banner1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47502899/101795693-25694380-3ad6-11eb-9c91-3e45c2221c58.png)

I'm a creative and curious idea translator providing everyday business solutions through tech. I’ve always had a dedicated mindset of “there has to be a better, easier, and ultimately more efficient way to do this,” and coding lets me exercise this dedication. I love learning about products I'm working on indepth and delivering solutions that exceed expectations. 

I'm passionate about innovation, empowering underrepresented communities, and leveling the playing field within STEM. I use my skills as a developer to make resources more accessible for those taking a non-traditional path into tech. Checkout some of our work at [The {G}Code House](https://t.co/EmihFhpHY2?amp=1)
